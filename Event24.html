                    Calypso GCEK held a night of star gazing at Astro Payyanur during Space Week, attended by 22
                    students and execs.
                    The program began with an interesting lecture by the founder of Astro Payyanur. After dinner at 7:30
                    P.M.,
                    we visited the mini planetarium and learned about various constellations. We returned to the seminar
                    hall for the next session,
                    but our star gazing was unfortunately interrupted due to cloudy skies. The next session on astrology
                    was held
                    at 4:30 A.M. with Mr. Gangadharan, who emphasized the importance of not blindly following
                    astrological beliefs. </p>

                    <p>We recently conducted an exciting virtual space treasure hunt that consisted of two rounds, both conducted online. The event was designed to engage and inspire the students and to promote their interest in space exploration and education.
